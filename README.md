## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (Includes npm)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-firebase-auth.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-firebase-auth.git)
    cd react-firebase-auth
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase. You'll need to set up your own Firebase project and configure it.

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Create a new project.
3.  Add a new web app to your Firebase project.
4.  Copy your Firebase configuration object. It will look something like this:
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
      authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
      storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
      messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
      appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
      measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID" // Optional
    };
    ```
5.  **Create a `.env` file** in the root of your project (`.env`).
6.  Add your Firebase configuration variables to this `.env` file. For Vite, they should be prefixed with `VITE_`:
    ```
    VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
    ```
    *Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY`, etc., with your actual Firebase values.*
